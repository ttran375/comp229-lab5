# Portfolio Site

## Instructions:

**Overview**: Create your Personal Portfolio Website using React

This site must include the pages from your Personal Portfolio 5 pages
– your **Home page**, an **About Me page**, a **Projects page**, a
**Services page**, and a **Contact Me page**.

1.  Your Site must include the appropriate content for a **Personal
    Portfolio (65 Marks: Content)**

    1.  You must include a **Navigation Bar** or other Navigation scheme
        that allows the user to view each page of your site.

    2.  You must include a **Custom Logo** for your site, this should be
        placed in or around the main Navigation bar. The **Custom Logo**
        can be as simple or artistic as you desire (e.g. you could use a
        primitive colour-filled shape like a triangle or hexagon with
        your initials positioned inside). Please do not use a logo that
        belongs to another company or person.

    3.  Your **Home Page** should include some sort of welcome message
        and link or button that allows the user to redirect to your
        About Me Page and / or other pages. I recommend also including
        some sort of **Mission Statement.**

    4.  Your **About Me Page** should include your legal name, an image
        of you (I recommend a head and shoulders shot), a short
        paragraph about who you are. Keep this clean and simple as it
        may be viewed by perspective employers.

    5.  Your **About Me page** should include a link to a PDF version of
        your Resume.

    6.  Your **Projects Page** should include images and information for
        at least 3 Projects you wish to highlight. These could be
        current projects you are working on or past projects you have
        completed. Include an image for each Project and a short
        description of your role and the outcome.

    7.  Your **Services Page** should include a short list of services
        you offer (e.g. general programming, web development, mobile
        apps, etc.). I recommend including images that make this more
        appealing to view.

    8.  Your **Contact Page** should include your contact information in
        a panel or other construct.

    9.  Your **Contact Page** should include a short interactive form
        that allows the user send you a message and provide basic
        contact information (First Name, Last Name, Contact Number,
        Email Address, Message, etc.). This form does not have to be
        fully functional initially. However, it should be able to
        capture the information entered by the user and redirect them
        back to the Home Page.

    10. Your **JavaScript**, **CSS and Multimedia Asset Files** are
        functional.

    11. All Your Code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, etc.) is error
        free.

1.  Include **Internal Documentation** for your site **(5 Marks:
    Internal Documentation):**

    1.  Ensure you include a **comment header** for your **CSS and
        JavaScript files** that indicate: the **File name**, **Student’s Name**, **StudentID, and Date.**

    1.  Ensure you include a **section headers** for all of your **HTML structure, CSS style sections,** and any **JavaScript functions.**

    1.  Ensure all your code uses **contextual variable names** that help
    make the files human- readable.

1.  Share your files on **GitHub** to demonstrate Version Control Best
    Practices and push your site to a cloud host **(10 Marks: Cloud
    Hosting).**

    1.  Your repository must include **your code** and be well
        structured.
